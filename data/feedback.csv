For example: “Three files are missing from merchants X, Y, and Z.” This is direct and specific about the error. The current text includes technical terms like ""re-t rigger ingestion"" and ""check landing location,"" which don't make sense to the client, as they don't have visibility into these processes. It's recommended to remove or rephrase these expressions using language that focuses directly on the problem In the yellow section the first three bullets are confusing and do not clearly identify the issue. Expressions like ""Tag as backfill and ensure downstream deduplication"" need to be better explained or rephrased, as it's still unclear what error is being flagged in this context. (I still don’t understand what the agent identified as the issue in this source.)"

1. Output Summary
Manual Checkup: :marca_de_verificación_blanca: 5 main error for AI to identify.
Result Accuracy (Manual vs. AI Output): 90%
2. Overall Assessment
:círculo_verde_grande: [X] OK :círculo_amarillo_grande: [] Needs Adjustment :círculo_rojo: [] Not OK
3. Main Divergences
All the red bullet points are accurate in both the first and second reports.
4. Comment
Comparing the first and second reports, there’s a slight difference, but nothing significant enough to impact today’s accuracy. One particularly important detail is that the first report includes the phrase ""Only 4/18 files received"", which makes the error much more direct and assertive. On the other hand, the second report provides a list of the missing files, which is also very helpful. The ideal scenario would be a combination of both: a clear and straightforward message that includes ""Only 4/18 files received"" along with the list of missing files for the day.
The problem is much more clear but the action is still confuse. "
